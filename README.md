# Girlscript GSSoC24 Alumni 

Welcome to Girlscript GSSoC24 Alumni ! This repository is dedicated to all things Alumni-related and will be updated periodically 😄. 

## Purpose
Until we have an official Alumni program set up, this repository serves as a hub for all Alumni activities. 
Feel free to contribute your own editions!

## Thank You
A big thank you for being part of Girlscript GSSoC24 . We're incredibly grateful for all the time and effort you've dedicated to this program. 💖

## Stay Connected
Please stick around on Slack once in a while 😄. 

## Why Was I Added?
You were added to this repository because you granted us permission to contact you in the 'offboarding' form. Remember, being a member of the Alumni team is entirely voluntary, and you can leave at any time ❤️.
